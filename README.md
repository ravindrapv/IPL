# Data Visualization Project README

This project contains data visualization using Highcharts. You can view the data visualization by following the steps below.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your computer.

## How to Access Data Visualization

1. Navigate to the `src/server/public` directory in your project.

2. In this directory, you will find an `index.html` file.

3. Right-click on the `index.html` file.

4. Choose to open the file with a live server extension or tool of your choice. For example, you can use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code or any other live server tool that you prefer.

5. The live server will open the `index.html` file in your default web browser.

6. The data visualization will be displayed in your web browser using Highcharts. You can interact with the visualization to explore the data.

7. Enjoy exploring the data visualization!

If you don't have a live server extension or tool, you can also use a local development server to serve the `index.html` file. Simply open your terminal, navigate to the `src/server/public` directory, and start a local server. For example, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx http-server
